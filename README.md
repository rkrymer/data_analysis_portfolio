# Randee Krymer - Data Analysis Portfolio

This portfolio includes a small sample of the work I have done over the past few weeks while teaching myself the fundamentals of data science. The projects were selected to demonstrate my ability to quickly and independently learn new technologies and ideas, and to show off the proficiency I have gained in essential Python data analysis libraries such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). While I am just beginning my data science career, I am an experienced and gifted programmer, and my technical expertise would be valuable to any data analysis team.
